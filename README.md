# EdxCourses_Data_Visualization
This project is divided into two parts:
▪ First part is the wrangling part, and it contains:
• data gathering.
• data assessing. 
• data cleaning.
▪ The second part is the visualization part, and it contains: 
• exploratory analysis.
• explanatory analysis.
• and then I turned this visualization into HTML slides that can be shown as 
a presentation, and this is called (storytelling about key findings).
